            <h2>On Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>
                I'll start off by saying that I didn't end up implementing the "unique" functionality for 
                this round because of time constraints and the focus of this assignment was creating / joining
                a chat and chatting. I focused more on getting the rough styling and 
                placement of various elements down, though there is also some work left to do there, 
                because it's easier for me to work through and get a feel for how things work when 
                they look like how I intend them for them to look. By getting the parts that people 
                expect to have in a chat app and the general layout out of the way, I expect to be able to work on 
                the additional features with a better sense of how they interface with the rest of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding how people "find" chats: they either make a chat or (currently) are added to 
                a chat by people already in that chat or whoever made the chat. For a future round, I 
                intend to add "invites" so that people can choose whether or not they join a chat rather 
                than being added directly, but I went with this implementation for now because it's 
                fairly standard and can be used a stepping stone to implementing "invites." Given the purpose 
                of the app, I found it unnecessary (and perhaps limiting) to have chats be topic-specific; 
                it would also somewhat defeat the purpose of the app to have it only allow direct messaging, 
                since scheduling generally becomes more of a problem when there are more people involved. 
                Since the chat involves group chats, I had the channels be randomly generated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, as aforementioned, group chats can be created; people can be added by the creator 
                while they're making the chat or by any member of the chat after the chat is made. I may 
                add in moderating or administrative roles later since it's not necessarily desirable for 
                anyone in the chat to be able to add others. On the other hand, one could assume that 
                if the creator is adding people to a chat, they trust those people to have the courtesy of 
                not adding in a bunch of random people. The chats don't allow users not added by users already 
                in the chat to just join the chat since people probably don't want random people knowing 
                where and when they intend to hang out. At the moment, users can't leave or be kicked out; these 
                are "to-be-implemented" features, for when I have a little more time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the usability goals: when an async operation is happening, the input and submit buttons 
                are grayed out, serving as loading signals. I think the async operations generally don't take too 
                long so a larger indication feels unnecessary to me at the moment but I may still implement 
                one later if I have time. I would say the interface feels generally consistent with other chat 
                apps I've used, although there are a few things I intend to implement later that should 
                make it feel even more consistent (e.g. moving the inputs for creating a chat to only appear 
                when a particular button instead of having it display by default). I did implement edit and 
                delete for messages and chat (names) so some mistakes are recoverable (if someone sent a text 
                before they actually intended to, they can fix that), but I have yet to implement leaving chats 
                due to time; with edit and delete, I'd also like to implement an undo feature, an indication 
                that a message was edited, and possibly an indication that a message was deleted. I used icons 
                instead of names because I'm assuming people have some familiarity with what icons are associated 
                with certain actions; I also intend to add text descriptions that show up when the user hovers 
                over an icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional notes: I called the app "meet" because it's intended to make it easier for people to 
                find a time to meet up and hang out. I chose to use calendar icons to indicate 
                the more unique features of the app, since people associate them with scheduling, 
                the hope being that the external consistency helps make the features more discoverable. 
                I made the background color of buttons change in addition to changing the cursor to be 
                a pointer to try to give more feedback to the user regarding the action they're about to take.
